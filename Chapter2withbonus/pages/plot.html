        <p>The film opens with Gorr (Christian Bale), a man who loses his ailing daughter in the wastelands, only to find a paradise controlled by the god Rapu (Jonny Burgh). After being coldly rejected by Rapu, Gorr takes up the Necrosword, a weapon capable of killing gods, and slays Rapu, vowing to destroy every god. Meanwhile, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) has returned to shape and is traveling with the Guardians of the Galaxy. Thor's ex-girlfriend, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), is diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and seeks Asgardian magic to save herself, ultimately becoming the Mighty Thor. As Gorr, now known as the God Butcher, starts capturing gods, including threatening New Asgard, Thor and his team—Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), Korg (Taika Waititi), and Jane—search for help from other gods, leading them to a disappointing encounter with Zeus (Russell Crowe). After a battle with Zeus and his forces, Thor’s team heads to the Shadow Realm to stop Gorr from reaching Eternity, a cosmic being that can grant wishes. Gorr captures the children of New Asgard, and in a final battle, Thor and Jane defeat him with help from the children, but not before Gorr uses his wish to reunite with his daughter before he dies. Jane, weakened by Mjolnir's power, dies in Thor's arms after a final moment of love. Thor adopts Gorr's daughter, naming her Love, and the two face new challenges together. Korg narrates the story’s conclusion, with New Asgard thriving and Thor raising Love. In mid-credits, Zeus plots revenge on Thor, setting up Hercules (Brett Goldstein) as his agent. In the post-credits, Jane’s spirit is welcomed into Valhalla by Heimdall (Idris Elba).</p>
